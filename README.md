# Automated Real-Time Monitoring and AI Fault Detection System for Solar Panels Using Advanced Image Detection

## Project Description
This project was designed so as to detect faulty solar panels caused by various factors such as physical damage, dusty, animal poop, covered in snow, and so on. The program is also trained to differentiate which solar panels are defective and which are not (good condition). The purpose is to avoid further deteriorations and to maintain the solar panels accurately and in a well timed manner. We believe this is aligned with the program's focus on maintaining the sustainability of clean and healthy energy (SDGs)🌼

### Problem Statement🚨

The lack of visibility into the condition of the solar panels due to factors such as dust, dirt, physical damage, and snow hampers preventive maintenance efforts, thus increasing operational costs. The solar panel maintenance team also has challenges in detecting failures or troubles in solar panels in a well-timed manner because of inefficient manual visual inspection, especially for panels located in hard-to-reach locations. This resulted in the possibility of more severe faults and decreased energy efficiency. The solar panel damage detection automation solution is present to solve the maintenance team's need to detect problems accurately and quickly, so that maintenance can be carried out more punctually and the panels function at an optimal level.

### Solution Statement💡

An automatic failure detection system uses AI (object detection) to analyze images of solar panels at frequent intervals, detecting various types of failures such as cracking, dirty areas, etc. The system generates reports showing the exact location and percentage of the failure, making it easier for technicians to carry out quick repairs and improving energy efficiency. The system generates reports showing the location and percentage of damage, enabling technicians to make quick repairs and improve energy efficiency. For landlords, the system provides real-time visibility into the condition of the panels, enabling efficient and proactive maintenance. With accurate data and historical reports, owners can minimize downtime, maximize energy production, and plan long-term investments and maintenance more effectively.

### Business Value🎯

The business solution proposed by this project is an automated system capable of detecting various types of failures in solar panels on a real-time and precise scale. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the system can analyze images of solar panels and provide early warnings to the maintenance team. This program has very significant business value, including:

1.) Efficiency Improvement⚡
- <b>Early Detection</b>:
Failures can be detected before they cause a significant drop in energy production, allowing companies to take immediate corrective action.
